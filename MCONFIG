# Do you want to have GNU readline and history support in 'ftp'. Use
# cursor keys to get your last commands.
# There are a number of versions of GNU readline floating around. 
# The one from the current version of bash should work; so should
# readline-2.0, which is available separately on GNU ftp sites.
# The ftp makefile assumes the headers are installed in 
# /usr/include/readline (or /usr/local/include/readline) and the 
# readline library itself is someplace where the linker can find it.
# If this doesn't apply, edit ftp/Makefile to taste.
#
# Note: some versions of readline don't install tilde.h, which is
# needed. Install it manually if necessary. 
#
# Further note: the readline library messes around with signals in a 
# way that causes ftp to misbehave (eg, exit on ^C while logged in.)
# Compiling readline with -D__USE_BSD_SIGNAL should fix this but may
# break other things... sigh.
#
# To resolve these problems future versions of this package will probably
# include a private copy of readline.

# Do you want to use the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) system
# for password lookups? Uncomment this if so. This may or may not actually
# work in this release.
#USE_PAM=1


#
# This is a broken flag to enable libwrap.a support in rexecd. For the 
# time being, leave this off and install rexecd wrapped in inetd.conf. 
# Or, better yet, don't install rexecd, as it's not very useful and not
# a very secure protocol.
# HAVE_TCP_WRAPPER_LIBRARY=true

# Compiler configuration
# Note that some directories may add stuff, and a few don't honor these.
# If you take out the __USE_BSD_SIGNAL, things will probably not work.
#
# On the PowerPC, you probably want to add -fsigned-char to CFLAGS.
#
# Note: if talk breaks because it can't find "unctrl.h", your ncurses 
# package is not installed correctly. Either link /usr/include/unctrl.h
# to /usr/include/ncurses/unctrl.h, fix /usr/include/ncurses/curses.h to
# include <ncurses/unctrl.h> instead of <unctrl.h>, or hack around the 
# problem by putting -I/usr/include/ncurses in the CFLAGS.
