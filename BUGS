reconcile with debian:
	rlogin 
	rlogind
	rsh
	rshd
	finger
	fingerd 	(-f permits forwarding)
	talk		(8-bit clean)
	talkd
	ftp		(uses ports above 40000)
	inetd		(bug fixes)
	tftp		"file search" mode
	tftpd

reconcile with netbsd:
	everything.

reconcile with openbsd:
	everything.

finger: 
	- prints nonsense timezone stuff
	- add option to issue CRs so fingerd doesn't need to fork
	- Some nameservers hose on "", patch finger to work around it

fingerd: 
	- rejection of finger forwarding should be optional

inetd:
	- will shut down services respawning too fast. Should bring them 
	  up again after a few minutes.
	- I'd appreciate if someone could try the Phrack inetd-killer of
	  a couple of months ago and let me know the results, if any.

rcp:
	- should call rsh instead of using root
	- pukes on files in /proc
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

rlogin: 
	- should use sigaction
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

rsh:
	- should try rexec if rcmd doesn't work
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

rpcgen:
	- should look for cpp in more places (eg, /usr/bin, /usr/libexec)

rusers/rusersd:
	- doesn't compile cleanly 

rwall/rwalld:
	- does not appear to work properly.

talk:
	- long-standing curses bugs associated with going off right side of
	  screen. (These appear to no longer happen now though.)
	- support word-wrap.
	- handle backspacing intelligently.
	- should do "connection closed, ^C to exit" like OSF/1 talk instead
	  of bailing and clearing the screen.

talkd:
	- talk request messages should check for 8 bit tty and not 
	  clear to 7 bits.
	- doesn't log flash attempts. 

telnet:
	- will apparently sometimes assert in ungetch. I think I've
	  fixed this, so if you still see it let me know.
	- hangs if you telnet to chargen port and push ^Z 
	  (due to bogus protocol negotiation attempts)
	- binary mode doesn't handle crlf right
	- should warn if the connection isn't encrypted

telnetd:
	- hangs if you do the following:
		telnet
		log in
		cat >/dev/null
		type 256 'a's with no CRs
	- crashes in ncurses if the terminal type is undefined,
	  with some versions of ncurses.
	- should allow passing random user envs as "TELNET_*"
	- should set REMOTEHOST to the remote hostname
	- passes login the -p flag instead of sending envs explicitly

overall:
	- stop using -lbsd
	- don't use inet_addr; use inet_aton instead
	- check (again) for bogus select parameters
