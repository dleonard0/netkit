23-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07 released.
	Integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
	  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
	Major security fixes, including to fingerd, lpr, rlogin, rsh, talkd, 
	  and telnetd. Do *not* use the sliplogin from earlier versions of this
	  package, either.
	Several of the daemons support better logging.
	Much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
	Massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc
	  -Wall now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix
	  this would be appreciated if anyone feels like it.
	New maintainer:  David A. Holland, dholland@hcs.harvard.edu

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.06 released.
	Added a missing argument in a printf to the finger source
	  code. Phil Edge
	"finger -l" prints the standard timezone when it should print the
	  daylight savings timezone. tzname[0] is standard timezone and
	  tzname[1] is daylight savings timezone.  This patch is from Phil
	  Edge. He wasn't too sure about this patch, and I haven't looked
	  into it. Anyone who really knows about this stuff? Look into
	  lprint.c in the finger source. I changed all "1 - daylight" into
	  "daylight"... You could also verify all Linux-specific changes
	  to timezone things. Other parts look also like duplicate work.
	  (Maybe even wrong...)

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.05 released.
	Fixed finger/util.c to cope with XDM login entry in utmp (Leonard
	  Zubkoff)

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.04 released.

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.03 released.
	Fixed fingerd to not use 'getdomainname' to get the FQDN.
