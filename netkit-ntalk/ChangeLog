9-Dec-1998:
	We don't need to check for BSD signal semantics now; updated
	  MCONFIG and regenerated configure script.

26-Nov-1998:
	Fixed bug: the talkd announce message is passed as the format 
	  string to fprintf, so if it has %'s in it, we probably crash.
	Copied <protocols/talkd.h> into include directory, because we
	  need to fiddle with it.
	Rearrange/clean up talkd source. Removed mytalkd.h.
	Added lots of checking and paranoia to packet handling. 
	Don't reply to the ctl_addr in the packet; reply to where the
	  packet came from.
	Created framework for working with bogus packets.
	Beefed up talkd's debug logging.
	Cleanup in talk. Removed talk_ctl.h.
	Fixed the problem where talk goes and blindly binds things to
	  the wrong local addresses.
	We don't need talk.FvK.patch any more, either.
	Filter high-ascii control characters in talk as well as regular
	  ones. (Olaf Kirch, okir@caldera.de)
	Don't zoom off the end of the string fields of the input packet in
	  talkd. (Olaf Kirch, okir@caldera.de)

22-Sep-1997:
	Fix talkd to use WIFEXITED et al. rather than assume things about
	the bits returned by wait.

12-Jun-1997:
	netkit-ntalk-0.10 released.

08-Jun-1997:

	glibc fixes from Red Hat.

05-Apr-1997:
	Added configure script to generate MCONFIG.
	Fix problem in talkd that issued PERMISSION_DENIED instead of
	  NOT_HERE. (Joerg Kleuver, kleuver@shadowgate.rhein.de, via 
	  Debian)
	Talk accepts ^H and ^? as erase characters regardless of stty
	  settings.
	Better utmp handling in talkd.

	Split from full NetKit package. 
	Generated this change log from NetKit's.

29-Dec-1996
	NetKit-0.09 released.
	Assorted alpha/glibc patches. (Erik Troan, ewt@redhat.com)
	Assorted bug fixes from Debian. (Peter Tobias, 
	  tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de)
	Hardened programs against DNS h_length spoofing attacks.
	Use inet_aton() everywhere instead of inet_addr().
	8-bit fixes to talk. (Christer Weinigel, wingel@dumburk.signum.se)

	Talk handles ^Z correctly now.

	(almost) everything now compiles with lots of warnings turned on.
	talk now beeps correctly with ncurses (fix from Marek Rouchal
	  <marek@btfmd1.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>.)

	NetKit-B-0.07A released.

23-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07 released.
	Integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
	  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
	Major security fixes, including to fingerd, lpr, rlogin, rsh, talkd, 
	  and telnetd. Do *not* use the sliplogin from earlier versions of this
	  package, either.
	talkd is flashproof.
	Much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
	Massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc
	  -Wall now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix
	  this would be appreciated if anyone feels like it.
	New maintainer:  David A. Holland, dholland@hcs.harvard.edu
