talk:
	- long-standing curses bugs associated with going off right side of
	  screen. (These appear to no longer happen now though.)
	- support word-wrap.
	- handle backspacing intelligently.
	- there are reports that it sometimes goes into a one-line-only 
	  mode where it only prints to the top line of the screen. I can't 
	  reproduce this, I'm afraid... insight welcome.
	- talk should behave more intelligently on systems with multiple
	  interfaces. 

talkd:
	- talk request messages should check for 8 bit tty and not 
	  clear to 7 bits.
	- doesn't log flash attempts.
