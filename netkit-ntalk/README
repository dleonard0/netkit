This is netkit-ntalk-0.11.

This package updates netkit-ntalk-0.10. It contains the talk client,
talk, and the talk daemon, talkd. It is the current version of the
talk and talkd that were distributed in NetKit-0.09.

This is an interim release. Another release is expected before too long. 

Contents:
	This package contains the programs talk and talkd.

	If you're reading this off a CD, go right away and check the
	net archives for later versions and security fixes.
	
Requirements: (These are known to work; you can probably use much
earlier versions of libc, gcc, or the kernel.)

	libc 5.4 or higher 
		Older libc versions will work but anything before 5.4.6 
		includes some nasty security bugs. All the NetKit programs 
		are believed immune to these, but the rest of your system 
		probably isn't... 

		Note: libc 5.0.x is not supported and won't work.
		
		glibc 2.0.x and 2.1.x are expected to work with this release.

	linux 2.0 or higher 
		NetKit itself will probably work with anything since 0.99pl14,
		although some hacking would probably be required.

	gcc 2.7.2 or higher
		Please get the strength-reduce fix if you don't have it.

	libncurses
		Any recent version should be ok.

Please make sure your header files in /usr/include match your libc
version installed in /lib and /usr/lib. If you have weird problems
this is the most likely culprit.


Installation:
	Do "./configure", or edit MCONFIG to set the configuration options. 
	Do "make".
	Do "make install" as root to install everything. Save backup copies 
	  of important tools, or confirm the new ones work first. Etc. We 
	  warned you.

Security:
	This release contains no security fixes relative to the talk
	and talkd from NetKit-0.09. Versions prior to NetKit-0.09
	should not be used.

Features:
	talk should now work correctly on multihomed machines (those
	with multiple IP addresses).

	talkd now contains code to hopefully detect and handle certain
	kinds of mangled talk packets that you may encounter. It also
	now has an option to log talk packets it doesn't understand;
	see the man page. Hopefully this will be useful if you run into
	interoperability problems.

Other notes:
	Use of the "wordwrap.patch" patch is neither recommended
	nor discouraged. Apply it at your discretion.

Bugs:
	If something doesn't compile for you, send diffs. If you can't
	send diffs, send the compiler's error output.

	If it compiles but doesn't work, send as complete a bug report as 
	you can. Patches and fixes are welcome, as long as you describe 
	adequately what they're supposed to fix. Please, one patch per
	distinct fix.

	Be sure to send all correspondence in e-mail. Postings to netnews 
	will not be seen due to the enormous volume.

	Please don't report known bugs (see the BUGS file(s)) unless you
	are including fixes. :-)
