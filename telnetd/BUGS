BTW: I received another bug report concerning telnetd. If you
say "telnet localhost", type "cat >/dev/null" and then type 256 times
the a character the telnet session will freeze. It hangs in a select
call (around line 975 in telnetd.c).

[I can duplicate this, but I can't figure out what's wrong, so if
anyone has any ideas let me know. I'm not going to hold up the netkit
release for it...]
