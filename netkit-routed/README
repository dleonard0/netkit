This is netkit-routed-0.16.

This package updates netkit-routed-0.11.

If you're reading this off a CD, go right away and check the net
archives for later versions and security fixes.

Contents:
	routed		RIP-based routing daemon
	ripquery	Query program for routed

Requires:
	Working compiler, libc, and kernel.

Security:
	This release contains no security fixes relative to
	netkit-routed-0.11. However, netkit-routed-0.10 and older are
	insecure and should not be used.

Installation:
	Do "./configure --help" and decide what options you want. The
	defaults should be suitable for most Linux systems. Then run
	the configure script.

	Do "make" to compile.
	Then (as root) do "make install".

	Save a backup copy of any mission-critical program in case the
	new one doesn't work, and so forth. We warned you.

DEC Alpha:
        Compaq were kind enought to make available their C compiler for
        the Alpha, you can down load this for free from
        http://www.unix.digital.com/linux (At time of document 25/11/1999)
        this package has been compiled and tested with this compiler as
        with the GNU compiler. To compile this from source simply issue
                CC=ccc ./configure
        Compaq C will moan in the following areas.
cc: Info: main.c, line 171: Code at or just after this location can never be executed. (unreachcode)
                query->rip_nets[0].rip_dst.sa_family = AF_UNSPEC;

cc: Info: startup.c, line 300: In this statement, the unsigned expression "ifp->int_transitions++" is being tested to see if it is greater than zero.  This might not be what you intended. (questcompare2)
        if (ifp->int_transitions++ > 0)

cc: Info: query.c, line 209: In this statement, the unsigned expression "msg->rip_vers" is being tested to see if it is greater than zero.  This might not be what you intended. (questcompare2)
            if (msg->rip_vers > 0) {
----------------^
	The GNU Compiler will compile cleanly without messages

Bugs:
	Please make sure the header files in /usr/include match the
	libc version installed in /lib and /usr/lib. If you have weird
	problems this is the most likely culprit.

	Also, before reporting a bug, be sure you're working with the
	latest version.

	If something doesn't compile for you, fix it and send diffs.
	If you can't, send the compiler's error output.

	If it compiles but doesn't work, send as complete a bug report as 
	you can. Patches and fixes are welcome, as long as you describe 
	adequately what they're supposed to fix. Please, one patch per
	distinct fix. Please do NOT send the whole archive back or
	reindent the source.

	Be sure to send all correspondence in e-mail. Postings to netnews 
	will not be seen due to the enormous volume.

	Please don't report known bugs (see the BUGS file(s)) unless you
	are including fixes. :-)

	Mail should be sent to: netbug@ftp.uk.linux.org

if you are curious why it's been so long since the last NetKit release.
(The short version is that I gave things to some other people, who let
them kind of slide.)

I do not currently plan to continue maintaining NetKit; I am doing this
release and perhaps one or two more, and then I intend to give the source
tree to Red Hat or some similar organization for long-term maintenance.
