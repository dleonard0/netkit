26-Aug-1998:
	* "query" and "trace" directories renamed to "routed-query"
	  and "routed-trace", and moved to upper directory
	* some cosmetic changes in "trace.c" from "routed-trace" and
	  in "query.c" from "routed-query"
	* "routed-trace/Makefile" supplied
	* "ripquery" target from "routed-query/Makefile" changed to
	  "routed-query" to avoid confusion with gated's "ripquery"
	* routed: introduced new "-r" commandline parameter. By default,
	  routed will not accept RIPCMD_TRACEON/OFF requests sent by
	  remote host, unless "-r" is specified. I know this is more
	  like kludge, but I had no idea on how this could be done
	  more efficiently. But the security is important. Acceptance
	  of RIPCMD_TRACEON/OFF sent remotely is done via
	  "ripcmd_trace_accepted" variable for now.
	* "routed" manpage updated
	* new man pages for "routed-trace" and "routed-query" introduced
