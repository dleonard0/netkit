This is a list of bugs for my NetBSD source collection for Linux.

Please email me, if you can give more detailed bug reports. Don't just
post to one of the newsgroups and think, I will see it...

If you feel like not working enough, you could just pick up one of the
mentioned bugs and find a bug-fix for it. Many bug reports are very
detailed.

I included the mail address of the people who reported the bugs, if it
seems necessary to me.

* Using the FTP in the net package, if I give the "sendport" command to
  disable sending of port commands I get "bind: address in use" error
  messages when I attempt to retrieve a file. "sendport" is useful when
  talking to overloaded FTP servers since port commands sometimes fail.

* After a while of running the machine, the rpc.portmapper begins to fork
  constantly. This only seems to happen when I have the rpc.ugidd also
  running.
  I have run the portmapper in debug mode and when it does go wild I get
  a pile of debug saying that it is about to enter the main switch in the
  portmapper source code.
  The problem does not happen on the two machines that I have at home networked.
  This only happens at work on a network with DEC 5000/240/260 and PC's etc.

  (Could someone please mail me, where I can find the newest version of
  rpc.ugidd? I want to include it into my net source collection on funet.fi)

* rpc.rwalld prints two messages instead of one. (fixed??)

* Do "telnet localhost chargen" and then hit Ctrl-C. The process will hang.
  You will have to go to another console and kill it with a HANGUP signal.
  There have been some Linux specific changes to signal handling, maybe
  we should convert back?

* "rsh" is known to have a problem: A stopped rsh command will block the
  port, so that other rsh commands will hang. Alan Cox has promised to fix
  the kernel for this. This should be gone with a very new kernel. (??)

* I have changed "timed" to compile for Linux, but I cannot test it.
  Could someone tell me, if it is working?
  It is not working, but someone is working on it...

* I use rpcgen from rpc-0.9. I should upgrade to the newer available version.
  But I have heard rumors, that they don't work ok for all source code.
  If newer versions work ok, I should delete source code for rpcgen and
  rpcinfo from my source collection.
  I couldn't find newer versions with archie. Where are they?

* bug report in german. I am too lazy to translate at the moment...
  in unserem kleinen lokalen linux-netzwerk sind alle benutzer ueber yp
  verwaltet. keine eintrage in der passwd (fuer benuzter).
  wenn ich nun finger <username> aufrufe, bekomme ich "no such user".
  finger -m <username> klappt.
  grund: ohne -m wird mit getpwent die passwortliste durchgegangen.
  ich weiss nicht, ob "getpwent" auch yp-maps durchstoebern sollte, aber
  offensichtlich tut's das auf jeden fall nicht.
  ich hab' fuer uns hier das problem dadurch geloest, dass ich in finger.c
  (wenn ohne -m gesucht wird) nach dem while(...getpwent...) nochmal
  fuer alle nicht gefundenen ueber getpwnam() suche.
