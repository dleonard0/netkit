* This is one of several source packages, containing a collection of net
  programs ready to compile for Linux.
  In this package are source files from NetBSD-current from 94/01/09.

  I plan to take a newer NetBSD version from time to time and see, if they
  have done important fixes. It would be also nice, if we could cooperate
  better between the NetBSD, FreeBSD and Linux people. (We all use the
  same basic source code, but do all our own fixes while constantly
  pretending not to look at the other group...)
  Communication on net-related things seems to be bad in general...
  Maybe 4.4BSD-Lite would be a good start for everybody to cooperate?

  If you put together a good binary package and fix some things, you do good
  work for the people *using* those binary packages. If you also make good
  context diffs, you also help the original authors of it.

* You should have the C library 4.5.26 or higher, gcc 2.5.7 or higher,
  linux kernel version 0.99.15 or higher.

* Make sure, you don't have old header files in your /usr/include directory.
  Alan Cox has put some extra header files onto sunacm to make Linux more
  compatible to BSD. Those should *NOT* be installed. Current consensus is,
  that they should be incorporated into the source packages that need them.
  (Only tcpdump and maybe few others.)

* Check the configuration options in the toplevel Makefile.

* Do a "make" to compile everything. Maybe use "make 2>&1 | less" to check
  everything. Do a "make install" as root to install everything.

* If you want to see, what exactly has changed for the linux version do:
  find arp -name '*,v' | sed 's/,v$//' | sort | \
                xargs -r -ihugo rcsdiff -q -u -L hugo hugo | less
  (Yeah, that's why Unix is so cool...)

* If you only want to install in the "ftp" dir, do "make SUB=ftp" and
  "make SUB=ftp install".

* I will not find your bug fixes, if you just post them to one of the
  newsgroups. Please email them to me.
