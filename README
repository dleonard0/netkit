This is netkit-combo-0.16.

This package contains the following packages that are also distributed
individually:

	biff+comsat-0.16
	bsd-finger-0.16
	linux-ftpd-0.16
	netkit-base-0.16
	netkit-bootparamd-0.16
	netkit-ftp-0.16
	netkit-ntalk-0.16
	netkit-routed-0.16
	netkit-rpc-0.16
	netkit-rsh-0.16
	netkit-rusers-0.16

	netkit-telnet-0.16
	netkit-tftp-0.16
	netkit-timed-0.16
	netwrite-0.16

If you are a distribution maintainer, you probably wish to fetch and
package each of those separately, so that your users can selectively
install and uninstall them.

If you are an end user, you may find it more convenient to use this
package, however. But, if you're reading this off a CD, go right away
and check the net archives for later versions and security fixes.



Requires:
	Working compiler, libc, and kernel, and a recent ncurses.

Security:
	Several of the NetKit packages contain security fixes in this
	release relative to the 0.10 or 0.11 releases. Please consult
	the individual package READMEs for details.

	Versions prior to NetKit-0.09 should not be used under any
	circumstances.

Installation:
	Do "./configure --help" and decide what options you want. The
	defaults should be suitable for most Linux systems. Then run
	the configure script.

	Do "make" to compile.
	Then (as root) do "make install".

	Save a backup copy of any mission-critical program in case the
	new one doesn't work, and so forth. We warned you.

Bugs:
	Please make sure the header files in /usr/include match the
	libc version installed in /lib and /usr/lib. If you have weird
	problems this is the most likely culprit.

	Also, before reporting a bug, be sure you're working with the
	latest version.

	If something doesn't compile for you, fix it and send diffs.
	If you can't, send the compiler's error output.

	If it compiles but doesn't work, send as complete a bug report as 
	you can. Patches and fixes are welcome, as long as you describe 
	adequately what they're supposed to fix. Please, one patch per
	distinct fix. Please do NOT send the whole archive back or
	reindent the source.

	Be sure to send all correspondence in e-mail. Postings to netnews 
	will not be seen due to the enormous volume.

	Please don't report known bugs (see the BUGS file(s)) unless you
	are including fixes. :-)

	Mail should be sent to: netbug@ftp.uk.linux.org


Note: please see http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~dholland/computers/netkit.html
if you are curious why it's been so long since the last NetKit release.
(The short version is that I gave things to some other people, who let
them kind of slide.)

I do not currently plan to continue maintaining NetKit; I am doing this
release and perhaps one or two more, and then I intend to give the source
tree to Red Hat or some similar organization for long-term maintenance.
