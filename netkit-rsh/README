This is netkit-rsh-0.16.

This package updates netkit-rsh-0.10. 

If you're reading this off a CD, go right away and check the net
archives for later versions and security fixes.

Contents:
	rexec		Password-based remote execution program
	rsh		Non-password-based remote execution program
	rcp		Remote copy program using rsh
	rlogin		Remote login program
	rshd		Daemon for rsh connections
	rexecd		Daemon for rexec connections
	rlogind		Daemon for rlogin connections
	
Note: None of these programs provide encryption or strong
authentication of network connections. As such, their use is
discouraged. The "ssh" protocol and package is a cryptographically
secure replacement.

Requires:
	Working compiler, libc, and kernel, and a recent ncurses or
	libtermcap.

Security:
	This release contains no security fixes relative to
	netkit-rsh-0.10. However, as noted above, all programs in this
	package are inherently insecure except on trusted networks.
	They should not be used at all except with great caution.
	This package is maintained chiefly for the sake of compatibility.

	Note: do not rely on the behavior of the options that limit 
	the use of .rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv without testing them, as
	some of them depend on undocumented libc interfaces that may not
	work correctly on all systems.

	Versions of these programs prior to netkit-rsh-0.10 should not
	be used.

Installation:
	Do "./configure --help" and decide what options you want. The
	defaults should be suitable for most Linux systems. Then run
	the configure script.

	Do "make" to compile.
	Then (as root) do "make install".

	Save a backup copy of any mission-critical program in case the
	new one doesn't work, and so forth. We warned you.

	WARNING: The PAM support in this version may be screwed up. If
	you use PAM, please be sure to double- and triple-check the
	behavior of rshd, rlogind, and rexecd to make sure they don't
	inadvertently grant access when it should be denied. If in doubt,
	get the SRPMs from Red Hat and use their sources instead.

DEC Alpha:
        Compaq were kind enought to make available their C compiler for
        the Alpha, you can down load this for free from
        http://www.unix.digital.com/linux (At time of document 25/11/1999)
        this package has been compiled and tested with this compiler as
        with the GNU compiler. To compile this from source simply issue
                CC=ccc ./configure
        Compaq C will moan in the following areas.

Bugs:
	Please make sure the header files in /usr/include match the
	libc version installed in /lib and /usr/lib. If you have weird
	problems this is the most likely culprit.

	Also, before reporting a bug, be sure you're working with the
	latest version.

	If something doesn't compile for you, fix it and send diffs.
	If you can't, send the compiler's error output.

	If it compiles but doesn't work, send as complete a bug report as 
	you can. Patches and fixes are welcome, as long as you describe 
	adequately what they're supposed to fix. Please, one patch per
	distinct fix. Please do NOT send the whole archive back or
	reindent the source.

	Be sure to send all correspondence in e-mail. Postings to netnews 
	will not be seen due to the enormous volume.

	Please don't report known bugs (see the BUGS file(s)) unless you
	are including fixes. :-)

	Mail should be sent to: netbug@ftp.uk.linux.org


Note: please see http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~dholland/computers/netkit.html
if you are curious why it's been so long since the last NetKit release.
(The short version is that I gave things to some other people, who let
them kind of slide.)

I do not currently plan to continue maintaining NetKit; I am doing this
release and perhaps one or two more, and then I intend to give the source
tree to Red Hat or some similar organization for long-term maintenance.
