This is a port of the OpenBSD ftp daemon.
The source was retrieved from ftp.openbsd.org on Mon May 19 06:20:58 EDT 1997,
including the files
	extern.h	ftpcmd.y	ftpd.8		ftpd.c
	logutmp.c	logwtmp.c	pathnames.h	popen.c

These came from src/libexec/ftpd.
The support files came from various sources, including OpenBSD's libc,
NetKit 0.09, and sendmail 8.7.4. (8.7.4 because it was handy, not for
any particular reason.) Others were written for this port.

This version does not put ftp users in utmp; the utmp code is #if'd out.
This means the -U option does not work.

Send bug reports and whatnot to me, not to OpenBSD, as the OpenBSD
organization doesn't have anything official to do with this port.
I'll forward them if necessary.

Please don't use linux-ftpd-0.09 any longer as it's rather broken and
this version is in all respects superior.

To install, edit MCONFIG, make, and make install. For configuration
instructions, read the man page, keeping in mind that it's for OpenBSD
and hasn't been edited for Linux. (This will be fixed eventually.)
