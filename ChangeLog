ToDo:
- Remove logwtmp.c from rlogind and telnetd, if they are fixed in the
  linux shared C library.
  Maybe leave these versions together with the programs and add stuff like
  recording the IP address.
- Install all programs like in.ftpd in /usr/libexec/ ?
- You could change talk to use ncurses instead of bsd curses.
- Remove rdist and portmap.old source directory.
- Look at Wietses logdaemon source code and do the same changes to our code.
  (This is easy work. Anybody can to that...)
- Don't put all things in one directory, but make a better dir structure.
  Suggested by Daniel Quinland:
  ./daemons     Standard networking daemons \
        /inetd  inetd-based daemons          -> I think these all are
        /rpc    daemons that use Sun RPC    /   placed in /usr/sbin
  ./clients     Standard networking clients -> some in /bin & most in /usr/bin
  ./etc         Et cetera files       -> All of these go in /etc, I think.

New in 0.06:
- rsh was exiting before all of the output from the remote command was
  finished. This only happened together with Solaris machines, not SunOS 4.1.
  (Mark Weaver Mark_Weaver@brown.edu)
  Could you all please give rsh a very hard test?
- Added a missing argument in a printf to the finger source code. Phil Edge
- "finger -l" prints the standard timezone when it should print the daylight
  savings timezone. tzname[0] is standard timezone and tzname[1] is daylight
  savings timezone.  This patch is from Phil Edge. He wasn't too sure about
  this patch, and I haven't looked into it. Anyone who really knows about
  this stuff? Look into lprint.c in the finger source. I changed all
  "1 - daylight" into "daylight"... You could also verify all Linux-specific
  changes to timezone things. Other parts look also like duplicate work.
  (Maybe even wrong...)
- ping uses no a correct minimum packet size (John Richardson)
- New portmapper by Wietse Venema. You need NetKit-A with its tcp_wrapper
  installed to compile it...  Who wants to contact Wietse and write a good
  man page for it? I have just taken the old one... Read in the source
  directory the information...
- Have talk be interruptable by Ctrl-Z from John Tombs (haven't tested this)


New in 0.05:
- Fixed writing entries to /var/adm/wtmp by ftpd, rlogind and
  telnetd. (logwtmp.c) Florian
  This is only necessary for the GNU last, not for the one in util-linux...
- Fixed finger/util.c to cope with XDM login entry in utmp (Leonard Zubkoff)
- Put "YACC=bison -y" in the main Makefile (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Fixed talk connection problem for multihomed hosts (Pauline Middelink)
  This patch must be activated by editing the Makefile of "talk" as this
  is not the correct way to set up a linux host/solve this problem...
- Fixed rdist to not work with freed memory, done by Florian (that's me)
- Kept rdist source, but don't install it. It has security problems and there
  is a better (rewritten) rdist available.
- Changed rsh to stop lookin for options after the first non-option.
  (See POSIXLY_CORRECT environment and "+" as first option for GNU getopt.)
- Don't install /etc/rpc.


New in 0.04:
- Added new program rdist from NetBSD with many bug-fixes from me.
- Changed inetd to store pid-file in /var/run.
- Changes to comsat and biff from newer NetBSD versions.
- Changes to talk and talkd from newer NetBSD versions.
- 'arp' is no longer installed. The Linux version is better and the BSD
  version currently doesn't work anyway. (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Install slattach as bsdslattach, since we have also a Linux version of it.
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed Makefile, so that rpcgen was build before it is needed...
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed several Makefiles from "../rpcgen/rpcgen" to "../rpcgen.new/rpcgen".
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed in routed to not define AF_MAX when it is already defined.
- gcc 2.6.0 told me, that a local variable was returned in rpc.rusersd.
  Changed that ivariable to be static.
- Did some nasty changes to telnet/extern.h. I should really take the current
  version from NetBSD again and make a clean port of it. (signals).

New in 0.03: (may be incomplete, please make context diffs to catch all)
- fixed "lprm" to properly remove queued files (maybe this was already in
  release 0.02 ??)
- fixed fingerd to not use 'getdomainname' to get the FQDN.
- added identd to /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf
- telnetd: changed the default 'etc/issue.net' to not output the hostname and
  then the domainname (that should be the fqdn, but is wrong!)
  changed also the man page issue.net.5
- changed telnetd to get the fqdn and not only use what 'gethostname' returns
- telnetd: changed some code back to original form to properly enable
  binary mode negotiation (outgoing data wasn't binary)
  Please test this out: do "telnet some_other_not_linux_host" and then do
  "vi TEST_FILE" and test some strange characters >127 like ° or §.
- Changed rusers, rpc.ruserd, rwall, rpc.rwalld, rwho, rwhod to not require
  to copy ./include/*.h files into /usr/include
- telnetd: added issue.net.5 to "make install"
- I found a bug-fix on of the news groups by Ulf Rimkus
  ulf@pc0435.psychologie.uni-marburg.de. 'rexecd' didn't set the environment
  at all. (Though it prepares all data for it...)
- Read 'BUGS' to see, how many of the bugs just have disappeared...
