New in 0.08: (?-Aug-1996)
- fixed some minor makefile bugs in the .07A release
- no longer distribute the broken lpr sources, or old rpcgen or slattach.
- massive hacking on telnet
- telnet honors the -E flag (was broken in .07, .07A)
- telnetd intercepts ENV environment variable
- ping -l (preload flood) requires uid 0
- rpcgen now puts some standard includes in its generated c.
- fixed rusers to use the right .x files with rpcgen.
- fixed rusers and rwall to use rpcgen correctly.
- fingerd uses fork instead of system for running uptime (with -w flag).
- fingerd supports -L flag to run alternate finger client.
- fixed some memory allocation bugs in ftp.
- fixed rexecd to use fd_sets correctly.
- fixed possible DNS spoofing buffer overrun vulnerability in tftp.
- merged libtelnet into telnet and telnetd dirs.
- fixed rwhod not to need -lbsd.
- fixed possible buffer overrun hole in rwhod.
- clear environment in setuid programs to protect against library bugs.
- (almost) everything now compiles with lots of warnings turned on.
- telnetd now sets idle tty devices to root.root mode 600.
- fingerd now accepts a new -u flag to reject "finger @host" queries.
- fix bug in finger that prevented matching full names
  (fix from James Jones <james@richland.cc.il.us>.)
- talk now beeps correctly with ncurses (fix from Marek Rouchal
  <marek@btfmd1.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>.)
- fix assorted bugs in timed 
  (from Clause Heine <Clause_Heine@ac2.maus.de>.) 
- ping sets SO_BROADCAST so pinging the broadcast address works.

New in 0.07A: (25-Jul-1996)
- fixed the top-level makefile.
- removed old versions of rpcgen and slattach.
- fixed a bug in telnet where the escape character was being ignored.
- fixed a bug in telnetd; now uses the correct names for the last ptys
  (that is, ptya0-ptyef, not ptyA0-ptyEf.)

New in 0.07: (23-Jul-1996)
- removed portmap; use Wietse Venema's portmap.
- removed rdist; use rdist 6.x distributed separately.
- removed sliplogin; use the one distributed separately and read the
  security bulletins.
- deprecated ftpd; use wu_ftpd or ftpd-diku or the 4.4BSD ftpd or
  something, but, please, not this one.
- deprecated routed; I don't see how it could ever have worked, frankly.
- deprecated lpr; please use LPRng or PLP. 
- integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
- major security fixes, including to fingerd, lpr, rlogin, rsh, talkd, 
  and telnetd. Do *not* use the sliplogin from earlier versions of this
  package, either.
- talkd is flashproof.
- several of the daemons support better logging.
- much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
- massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc -Wall 
  now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix this would be
  appreciated if anyone feels like it.
- Kerberos support has been removed. It didn't work anyway, and proper
  Kerberos tools come with Kerberos.
- added experimental support for PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
  which may or may not actually work...
- new maintainer:  David A. Holland, dholland@hcs.harvard.edu

New in 0.06:
- rsh was exiting before all of the output from the remote command was
  finished. This only happened together with Solaris machines, not SunOS 4.1.
  (Mark Weaver Mark_Weaver@brown.edu)
  Could you all please give rsh a very hard test?
- Added a missing argument in a printf to the finger source code. Phil Edge
- "finger -l" prints the standard timezone when it should print the daylight
  savings timezone. tzname[0] is standard timezone and tzname[1] is daylight
  savings timezone.  This patch is from Phil Edge. He wasn't too sure about
  this patch, and I haven't looked into it. Anyone who really knows about
  this stuff? Look into lprint.c in the finger source. I changed all
  "1 - daylight" into "daylight"... You could also verify all Linux-specific
  changes to timezone things. Other parts look also like duplicate work.
  (Maybe even wrong...)
- ping uses no a correct minimum packet size (John Richardson)
- New portmapper by Wietse Venema. You need NetKit-A with its tcp_wrapper
  installed to compile it...  Who wants to contact Wietse and write a good
  man page for it? I have just taken the old one... Read in the source
  directory the information...
- Have talk be interruptable by Ctrl-Z from John Tombs (haven't tested this)


New in 0.05:
- Fixed writing entries to /var/adm/wtmp by ftpd, rlogind and
  telnetd. (logwtmp.c) Florian
  This is only necessary for the GNU last, not for the one in util-linux...
- Fixed finger/util.c to cope with XDM login entry in utmp (Leonard Zubkoff)
- Put "YACC=bison -y" in the main Makefile (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Fixed talk connection problem for multihomed hosts (Pauline Middelink)
  This patch must be activated by editing the Makefile of "talk" as this
  is not the correct way to set up a linux host/solve this problem...
- Fixed rdist to not work with freed memory, done by Florian (that's me)
- Kept rdist source, but don't install it. It has security problems and there
  is a better (rewritten) rdist available.
- Changed rsh to stop lookin for options after the first non-option.
  (See POSIXLY_CORRECT environment and "+" as first option for GNU getopt.)
- Don't install /etc/rpc.


New in 0.04:
- Added new program rdist from NetBSD with many bug-fixes from me.
- Changed inetd to store pid-file in /var/run.
- Changes to comsat and biff from newer NetBSD versions.
- Changes to talk and talkd from newer NetBSD versions.
- 'arp' is no longer installed. The Linux version is better and the BSD
  version currently doesn't work anyway. (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Install slattach as bsdslattach, since we have also a Linux version of it.
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed Makefile, so that rpcgen was build before it is needed...
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed several Makefiles from "../rpcgen/rpcgen" to "../rpcgen.new/rpcgen".
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed in routed to not define AF_MAX when it is already defined.
- gcc 2.6.0 told me, that a local variable was returned in rpc.rusersd.
  Changed that ivariable to be static.
- Did some nasty changes to telnet/extern.h. I should really take the current
  version from NetBSD again and make a clean port of it. (signals).

New in 0.03: (may be incomplete, please make context diffs to catch all)
- fixed "lprm" to properly remove queued files (maybe this was already in
  release 0.02 ??)
- fixed fingerd to not use 'getdomainname' to get the FQDN.
- added identd to /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf
- telnetd: changed the default 'etc/issue.net' to not output the hostname and
  then the domainname (that should be the fqdn, but is wrong!)
  changed also the man page issue.net.5
- changed telnetd to get the fqdn and not only use what 'gethostname' returns
- telnetd: changed some code back to original form to properly enable
  binary mode negotiation (outgoing data wasn't binary)
  Please test this out: do "telnet some_other_not_linux_host" and then do
  "vi TEST_FILE" and test some strange characters >127 like ° or §.
- Changed rusers, rpc.ruserd, rwall, rpc.rwalld, rwho, rwhod to not require
  to copy ./include/*.h files into /usr/include
- telnetd: added issue.net.5 to "make install"
- I found a bug-fix on of the news groups by Ulf Rimkus
  ulf@pc0435.psychologie.uni-marburg.de. 'rexecd' didn't set the environment
  at all. (Though it prepares all data for it...)
- Read 'BUGS' to see, how many of the bugs just have disappeared...
