New in 0.04:
- Added new program rdist from NetBSD with many bug-fixes from me.
- Changed inetd to store pid-file in /var/run.
- Changes to comsat and biff from newer NetBSD versions.
- Changes to talk and talkd from newer NetBSD versions.
- 'arp' is no longer installed. The Linux version is better and the BSD
  version currently doesn't work anyway. (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Install slattach as bsdslattach, since we have also a Linux version of it.
  (Resa Ruokonen)
- Changed Makefile, so that rpcgen was build before it is needed...
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed several Makefiles from "../rpcgen/rpcgen" to "../rpcgen.new/rpcgen".
  (Vesa Ruokonen)
- Changed in routed to not define AF_MAX when it is already defined.
- gcc 2.6.0 told me, that a local variable was returned in rpc.rusersd.
  Changed that ivariable to be static.
- Did some nasty changes to telnet/extern.h. I should really take the current
  version from NetBSD again and make a clean port of it. (signals).

New in 0.03: (may be incomplete, please make context diffs to catch all)
- fixed "lprm" to properly remove queued files (maybe this was already in
  release 0.02 ??)
- fixed fingerd to not use 'getdomainname' to get the FQDN.
- added identd to /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf
- telnetd: changed the default 'etc/issue.net' to not output the hostname and
  then the domainname (that should be the fqdn, but is wrong!)
  changed also the man page issue.net.5
- changed telnetd to get the fqdn and not only use what 'gethostname' returns
- telnetd: changed some code back to original form to properly enable
  binary mode negotiation (outgoing data wasn't binary)
  Please test this out: do "telnet some_other_not_linux_host" and then do
  "vi TEST_FILE" and test some strange characters >127 like ° or §.
- Changed rusers, rpc.ruserd, rwall, rpc.rwalld, rwho, rwhod to not require
  to copy ./include/*.h files into /usr/include
- telnetd: added issue.net.5 to "make install"
- I found a bug-fix on of the news groups by Ulf Rimkus
  ulf@pc0435.psychologie.uni-marburg.de. 'rexecd' didn't set the environment
  at all. (Though it prepares all data for it...)
- Read 'BUGS' to see, how many of the bugs just have disappeared...
