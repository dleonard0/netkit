This is netkit-timed-0.16 for Linux.

This package updates netkit-timed-0.12.

If you're reading this off a CD, go right away and check the net
archives for later versions and security fixes.

Note: for general use, xntpd is recommended. timed should only be used
in cases where xntpd, or another ntp daemon, cannot be used.

Contents:
	timed		Time daemon
	timedc		Client for time daemon

Requires:
	Working compiler, libc, and kernel.

	Old pre-release versions of glibc (before 2.0) are no longer
	supported and will not work.

Installation:
	Do "./configure --help" and decide what options you want. The
	defaults should be suitable for most Linux systems. Then run
	the configure script.

	Do "make" to compile.
	Then (as root) do "make install".

	Save a backup copy of any mission-critical program in case the
	new one doesn't work, and so forth. We warned you.

Security:
	This release contains no security fixes relative to
	netkit-timed-0.12. Versions prior to netkit-timed-0.10
	should not be used, however.

Bugs:
	Please make sure your header files in /usr/include match your
	libc version installed in /lib and /usr/lib. If you have weird
	problems this is the most likely culprit.

	Also, before reporting a bug, be sure you're working with the
	latest version.

	If something doesn't compile for you, fix it and send diffs.
	If you can't, send the compiler's error output.

	If it compiles but doesn't work, send as complete a bug report as 
	you can. Patches and fixes are welcome, as long as you describe 
	adequately what they're supposed to fix. Please, one patch per
	distinct fix. Please do NOT send the whole archive back or
	reindent the source.

	Be sure to send all correspondence in e-mail. Postings to netnews 
	will not be seen due to the enormous volume.

	Please don't report known bugs (see the BUGS file(s)) unless you
	are including fixes. :-)

	Mail should be sent to: netbug@ftp.uk.linux.org

if you are curious why it's been so long since the last NetKit release.
(The short version is that I gave things to some other people, who let
them kind of slide.)

I do not currently plan to continue maintaining NetKit; I am doing this
release and perhaps one or two more, and then I intend to give the source
tree to Red Hat or some similar organization for long-term maintenance.
