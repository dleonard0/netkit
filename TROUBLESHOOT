Troubleshooting Guide

          ----------

Problem: telnetd dies mysteriously, especially when logging in from
terminal servers or DOS telnet clients or other places with strange
terminal type definitions. This is what it looks like in strace:

    open("/usr/lib/terminfo/0/01", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or 
    directory)
    access("/usr/lib/terminfo/0", R_OK)      = 0
    access("/etc/termcap", R_OK)             = 0
    --- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
    +++ killed by SIGSEGV +++

This is caused by a bug in ncurses. Update ncurses, problem will go
away. Explicitly setting a terminal type that's known (or listing the
unknown terminal type that's causing problems as an alias for "dumb"
in /etc/termcap) should serve to work around the problem.

          ----------

Problem: talk won't compile, because it can't find "unctrl.h".

This is due to your ncurses package not being installed correctly.
Either link /usr/include/unctrl.h to /usr/include/ncurses/unctrl.h,
edit /usr/include/ncurses/curses.h to include <ncurses/unctrl.h>
instead of <unctrl.h>, or hack around the problem by putting
-I/usr/include/ncurses in the CFLAGS. And complain to your
distribution maintainer.

          ----------

Problem: talk won't compile, and breaks on "ospeed".

This is usually because your /usr/include/curses.h is BSD curses and
not ncurses. Try adding -I/usr/include/ncurses to CFLAGS. This seems
to apply to recent Slackware releases.

          ----------

Problem: inetd won't compile, and breaks on "getrpcbyname".

You've got a broken /usr/include/netdb.h. This is usually caused by
installing BIND and replacing libc's netdb.h with BIND's. Reverting to
the standard netdb.h will solve the problem; it's also a reasonably
trivial fix to the BIND version.
