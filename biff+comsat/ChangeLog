14-Sep-1999:
	Fixed signal blocking in comsat to be POSIX.
	Fixed (or at least patched) comsat DoS attack by sleeping 0.1

	  process quotas.)

23-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07 released.
	Integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
	  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
	Much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
	Massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc
	  -Wall now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix
	  this would be appreciated if anyone feels like it.
	New maintainer:  David A. Holland, dholland@hcs.harvard.edu
