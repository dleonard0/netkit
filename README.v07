This is NetKit-B-0.07A.

This is probably the last or next to last NetKit-B. NetKit-A has
already officially ceased to exist.

NetKit-B-0.07A fixes some stupid bugs in NetKit-B-0.07.

In the future the components of the NetKit packages will be available
individually at ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/Networking, and
probably elsewhere as well. 

Contents: 
	NetKit-B contains the following programs:
		biff  comsat  finger  fingerd  ftp  inetd  ping  
		rlogin  rlogind  rcp  rpcgen  rpc.rusersd  
		rpc.rwalld  rpcinfo  rsh  rshd  rusers  rwall  
		rwho  rwhod  bsdslattach  talk  talkd  telnet
		telnetd  timed

	Please don't use older versions of fingerd, ping, rsh, rshd, 
	rlogin, talkd, or telnetd (and perhaps others).

	NetKit-B also contains the following programs that you
	shouldn't even install unless you need them:
		rexecd  tftp  tftpd

	If you're reading this off a CD, go right away and check the
	net archives for later versions and security fixes.
	
	If you are updating from NetKit-B-0.06, you may also want to
	get the current versions of portmap, rdist, sliplogin, 
	and/or bsd-ftpd, as those are no longer included here. You 
	will also want to get LPRng or PLP to replace lpr, as that is
	no longer included either. All of these can be gotten from
	ftp.uk.linux.org://pub/linux/Networking.


Requirements: (I know these work; you can probably use much earlier 
versions of libc, gcc, or the kernel.)

	libc 5.2 or higher (though 4.x should work)
	linux 2.0 or higher (as early as 0.99pl15 might work...)
	gcc 2.7.2 (please get the strength-reduce fix if you don't have it) 
	libncurses (any recent version)
	libtermcap (substituting libncurses for this will NOT work)
	libreadline (GNU readline library) is optional but recommended.

Please make sure your /usr/include matches your libc version. If you have 
weird problems this is the most likely culprit.


Installation:
	Edit MCONFIG to set the configuration options. 
	You also may want to edit the top-level Makefile to select 
	  which programs to build and install.
	Do "make".
	Do "make install" as root to install everything. Save backup copies 
	  of important tools, or confirm the new ones work first. Etc. We 
	  warned you.

Bugs:
	There was a great deal of hacking on the sources for this version.
	Everything that's supposed to be able to compile (see the Makefile)
	compiles for me. If it doesn't compile for you, send diffs. If you 
	can't send diffs, send the compiler's error output. 

	If it compiles but doesn't work, send as complete a bug report as 
	you can. Patches and fixes are welcome, as long as you describe 
	adequately what they're supposed to fix. 

	Be sure to send all correspondence in e-mail. Postings to netnews 
	will almost certainly not be seen due to the enormous volume.

	The following bugs are known but are not fixed in this release
	(this is so this release can get released in the near future):

		- ftp doesn't handle ^C right when linked with readline.
		- talkd doesn't log flash attempts. 
		- rwall does not appear to work properly.
		- rusers and rusersd get compiler warnings.
		- rcp pukes on files in /proc.
		- telnet dumps core if linked with ncurses.


Special thanks to Elliot Lee of Red Hat for patches and testing and
general help.
