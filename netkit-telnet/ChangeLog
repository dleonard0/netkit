	NetKit-0.09 released.
	Assorted alpha/glibc patches. (Erik Troan, ewt@redhat.com)
	Assorted bug fixes from Debian. (Peter Tobias, 
	  tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de)
	Telnetd supports -L option for alternate login program. (Peter Tobias)
	Hardened programs against DNS h_length spoofing attacks.
	Use inet_aton() everywhere instead of inet_addr().
	Fixed crash in telnet caused by ^C or ^Z or ^\ under 
	  certain circumstances.
	Rewrote telnet and telnetd man pages.

22-Aug-1996
	NetKit-B-0.08 released.
	(almost) everything now compiles with lots of warnings turned on.
	Massive hacking on telnet.
	telnet honors the -E flag (was broken in .07, .07A)
	telnetd intercepts ENV environment variable.
	Merged libtelnet into telnet and telnetd dirs.
	telnetd now sets idle tty devices to root.root mode 600.

25-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07A released.
	Fixed a bug in telnet where the escape character was being ignored.
	Fixed a bug in telnetd; now uses the correct names for the last ptys
	  (that is, ptya0-ptyef, not ptyA0-ptyEf.)

23-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07 released.
	Integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
	  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
	Major security fixes, including to fingerd, lpr, rlogin, rsh, talkd, 
	  and telnetd. Do *not* use the sliplogin from earlier versions of this
	  package, either.
	Much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
	Massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc
	  -Wall now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix
	  this would be appreciated if anyone feels like it.
	Kerberos support has been removed. It didn't work anyway, and
	  proper Kerberos tools come with Kerberos.
	New maintainer:  David A. Holland, dholland@hcs.harvard.edu

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.06 released.

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.05 released.
	Fixed writing entries to /var/adm/wtmp by ftpd, rlogind and
	  telnetd. (logwtmp.c) Florian
	  This is only necessary for the GNU last, not for the one 
	  in util-linux...

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.04 released.
	Did some nasty changes to telnet/extern.h. I should really take
	  the current version from NetBSD again and make a clean port of
	  it. (signals).

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.03 released.
	telnetd: changed the default 'etc/issue.net' to not output the
	  hostname and then the domainname (that should be the fqdn, but
	  is wrong!) Changed also the man page issue.net.5
	changed telnetd to get the fqdn and not only use what
	  'gethostname' returns
	telnetd: changed some code back to original form to properly
	  enable binary mode negotiation (outgoing data wasn't binary)
	  Please test this out: do "telnet some_other_not_linux_host" and
	  then do "vi TEST_FILE" and test some strange characters >127
	  like ° or §.
	telnetd: added issue.net.5 to "make install"
